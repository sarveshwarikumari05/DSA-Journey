# DSA-Journey
This repository focuses on building strong fundamentals by exploring how and why data structures and algorithms work, rather than limiting learning to syntax. Each topic is approached with clear explanations, logical breakdowns, and step-by-step problem analysis to develop a deep and transferable understanding.


Core Data Structures: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs

Algorithms: Searching, Sorting, Recursion, Greedy techniques, and basics of Dynamic Programming

Problem-solving strategies and approach building

Time and Space Complexity analysis

Edge cases and optimization insights


📌 Goal: To grow from understanding basic logic to confidently solving complex problems using efficient data structures and algorithms.
